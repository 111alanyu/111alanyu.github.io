        <h2>A bit about me:</h2>

        <p>
            Hi, my name is Alan and I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at UCLA. I am currently looking for
            internship and co-ops that will allow me to give me more industry experience. My past experience has mostly
            revolved around computer programming. I worked with Professor Weissman of Stanford University lead a team
            that
            researches what the intersection between olfaction and technology could be. Currently, I work under
            Professor
            Ozcan's lab to develop a more advanced air quality monitor and as a Software Consultant with Data Driven
            LLC.
            Furthermore, I have experience working with C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Python along with all the other
            typical office tools. Feel free to contact me at alanyu111@g.ucla.edu
