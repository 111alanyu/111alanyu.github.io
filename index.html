                            "I was very fortunate to have Alan as an intern at General Atomics in the summer of 2022. At
                            that time I was the Director of the Advanced Concepts group. Alan was immediately (on day 1)
                            given a high visibility task directly by the Vice President of our division.
                            <strong style="background-color: rgb(113, 100, 0);">
                                This task was not a simple one, and was previously planned to be executed by a whole
                                team of software engineers over many months.
                            </strong>

                            He was able to quickly pivot to the new task and did not shy away from the
                            project scope or high visibility. He took on the full task himself.
                            <strong style="background-color: rgb(113, 100, 0);"> In addition - this task
                                was in


                                support of a customer deliverable, and was critical for the division.
                                Not only did Alan acomplish the task - he did it with time to spare. He is an excellent
                                problem solver and communicator. He also is able to approach problems with the full big
                                picture view,
                                and routinely offered new solutions and approaches that were better than the original
                                plan.
                            </strong>
                            He was a powerhouse as a Freshman intern - I can't wait to see what he accomplishes next!

                    Summary: Exposure to bio-aerosols such as pollen can lead to adverse health effects. There is a need
                    for a portable and cost-effective device for long-term monitoring and quantification of various
                    types of pollen. To address this need, we present a mobile and cost-effective label-free sensor that
                    takes holographic images of flowing particulate matter (PM) concentrated by a virtual impactor,
                    which selectively slows down and guides particles larger than 6 Î¼m to fly through an imaging window.
                    The flowing particles are illuminated by a pulsed laser diode, casting their inline holograms on a
                    complementary metal-oxide semiconductor image sensor in a lens-free mobile imaging device. The
                    illumination contains three short pulses with a negligible shift of the flowing particle within one
                    pulse, and triplicate holograms of the same particle are recorded at a single frame before it exits
                    the imaging field-of-view, revealing different â€¦

                    â€¢ Personal Contributions: I worked on the Swift App where I implemented the map to locate the Lockr
                    and the search
                    feature to find specific items in various Lockrs

                    â€¢ Tech Stack: Our Hardware used Arduino and Common Electronics. Our Kiosk used React Native and
                    Google Firebase. Our Client App was on iOS and programmed with Swift
