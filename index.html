                        <p>

                            "I was very fortunate to have Alan as an intern at General Atomics in the summer of 2022. At
                            that time I was the Director of the Advanced Concepts group. Alan was immediately (on day 1)
                            given a high visibility task directly by the Vice President of our division.

                            This task was not a simple one, and was previously planned to be executed by a whole
                            team of software engineers over many months.

                            He was able to quickly pivot to the new task and did not shy away from the
                            project scope or high visibility. He took on the full task himself.
                            In addition - this task
                            was in


                            support of a customer deliverable, and was critical for the division.
                            Not only did Alan acomplish the task - he did it with time to spare. He is an excellent
                            problem solver and communicator. He also is able to approach problems with the full big
                            picture view,
                            and routinely offered new solutions and approaches that were better than the original
                            plan.

                            He was a powerhouse as a Freshman intern - I can't wait to see what he accomplishes next!

                        <h3> Paper Abstract:
                        </h3>
                        Exposure to bio-aerosols such as pollen can lead to adverse health effects. There is a need for
                        a portable and cost-effective device for long-term monitoring and quantification of various
                        types of pollen. To address this need, we present a mobile and cost-effective label-free sensor
                        that takes holographic images of flowing particulate matter (PM) concentrated by a virtual
                        impactor, which selectively slows down and guides particles larger than 6 μm to fly through an
                        imaging window. The flowing particles are illuminated by a pulsed laser diode, casting their
                        inline holograms on a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor image sensor in a lens-free mobile
                        imaging device. The illumination contains three short pulses with a negligible shift of the
                        flowing particle within one pulse, and triplicate holograms of the same particle are recorded at
                        a single frame before it exits the imaging field-of-view, revealing different perspectives of
                        each particle. The particles within the virtual impactor are localized through a differential
                        detection scheme, and a deep neural network classifies the pollen type in a label-free manner
                        based on the acquired holographic images. We demonstrated the success of this mobile pollen
                        detector with a virtual impactor using different types of pollen (i.e., bermuda, elm, oak, pine,
                        sycamore, and wheat) and achieved a blind classification accuracy of 92.91%. This mobile and
                        cost-effective device weighs ~700 g and can be used for label-free sensing and quantification of
                        various bio-aerosols over extended periods since it is based on a cartridge-free virtual
                        impactor that does not capture or immobilize PM.
